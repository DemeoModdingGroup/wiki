# Installing Melon Loader

## Determine your Demeo Directory

Depending on your installation of Demeo you may have your game located anywhere on your computer. Typically the default location is all you will need but you must locate the directory that contains the 'demeo.exe' file in order to install the Melon Loader application.\
Steam Default Directory: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Demeo\`\
Oculus Default Directory: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Oculus\Software\Software\resolution-games-demeo\`

## Using the Installer
The Melon Loader developers have provided an easy to use installer.\
You can download the installer from the [Melon Loader releases tab](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases). (Make sure the version is at least `v0.4.1`.)

Open up the installer and browse to the folder where the `demeo.exe` file is installed and then press Install.

Once the installation is complete you can browse to the directory where the `demeo.exe` file is located. You will see a number of folders have been created.\
To install a mod for Melon Loader you will need to place it in the `Mod\` directory at this location.

## Getting an alpha build (optional)
Now that you have the base loader installed you may need to install the latest alpha build from the Melon Loader [Actions tab](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/actions).\
Click on the latest run and download the artifact labeled `MelonLoader.x64.CI`.\
Extract the zip so that `version.dll` is in the same folder as `demeo.exe`.
